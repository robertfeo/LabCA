# Labor Computer Architecture

## Lab 1 
Program & debug software using Assembler, laying the ground-work for the later labs: learning how to control the UI based on LEDs, the LCD display and buttons as input.

## Lab 2 
Develop the core of the clock, using the HCS12â€™s timer module and some buttons, to let the user set the initial time. Additionally, the clock will use the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to measure the room temperature.

## Lab 3 
Extend the clock with a DCF77 radio-frequency interface, receiving the current date and time information via antenna, so that the clock automatically sets time, switches between normal time and daylight savings time and tracks the date and leap years correctly.
